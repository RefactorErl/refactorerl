%%% @doc A trivial event handler that send every UI event to a specified
%%% process. A new dispatcher process is started; this is neccessary to
%%% support initialization though rpc (see below). When the receiver process
%%% exits, the message handler is deleted.
%%%
%%% === Initialization using RPC ===
%%%
%%% When an RPC call is used to invoke {@link start/1}, which is the only
%%% possible way in case of using JInterface, the actual function call is made
%%% by the RPC server process. This would cause the RPC process to be linked
%%% with the message server instead of the process that actually receives the
%%% messages.
%%%
%%% This can only be solved by introducing a dispatcher process, which
%%% registers itself with the message server and gets linked with it, and
%%% links itself with the receiver process. This ensures the correct behaviour
%%% in case of the receiver process exits.
%%%
%%% === Possible enhancements ===
%%% <ol>
%%%  <li>Messages could be tagged (currently the bare events are sent)</li>
%%%  <li>Receiver process replacement could be supported</li>
%%% </ol>
%%%
%%% Currently there seems to be no need for these, although the first one is a
%%% step towards a much better architecture.
