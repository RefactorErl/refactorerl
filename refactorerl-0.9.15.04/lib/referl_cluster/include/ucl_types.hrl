%% Unified item type of the clustering. It is a record type.
%% All object are used in the clustering process may be stored in a `clItem' 
%% record. This unified format allow to the clustering algorithms to handle
%% the entities and attributes of a concrete task in same way independently 
%% to the the real source of the datas.
%%
%% An `clItem' record store information about the object itself not about the
%% role of it in the clustering process. For example if we cluster modules the
%% items conatain informations about the modules. Name, source file and so on.
%% But these don't contain information about the modules are entitites or 
%% attributes. A module can be entity and attribute simultaneously.
%% Informations about when the module is entity or attribute is stored in a
%% {@type clState()} record.

%%   <li>`id': The unique identifier of the object. It must be unique
%%     between all objects are stored in `clItem' records because the records
%%     are identified only by their `id' fields.</li>
%%   <li>`type': The type of the data stored in `clItem'. It can be an
%%     arbitrary atom. For example: if we cluster modules the entities can
%%     be module type nodes of the ESG. Than the `type' field let be `module'.
%%     </li>
%%   <li>`name': the name of the item. It will be used when the item 
%%     is writed out and the name is more suitable instead the `clItem'.
%%     For examle the nem of the module.</li>
%%   <li>`props': Any other informations about the item can be stored in this
%%     property list. The base modules of the clustering infrastucture never
